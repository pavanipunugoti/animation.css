This project demonstrates how to use HTML and CSS animations to create a visually appealing effect.
It displays a background image with two circles in the center:

A fixed orange circle in the middle.

A yellow circle that animates by scaling up and down, creating a breathing/pulsing effect.

No JavaScript is required â€” everything is done using pure CSS.
